Description

Another newsletter from [InterviewQs](https://www.interviewqs.com/). On this occasion, I was tasked to query 3 tables for total sales by location by product. I solved this problem in three SQL dialects, each in different files:

* [MSSQL](https://github.com/PaulinaJohn/Total_grocery_sales-SQL-InterviewQs/blob/main/interviewQS-answer.sql)
* PostgreSQL
* Standard SQL in BigQuery

The later two will be uploaded soon.
