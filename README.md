Description

Another newsletter from [InterviewQs](https://www.interviewqs.com/). On this occasion, I was tasked to query 3 tables for total sales by location by product. I solved this problem trying out 3 different RDBMSes.

* [MSSQL](https://github.com/PaulinaJohn/Total_grocery_sales-SQL-InterviewQs/blob/main/interviewQS-answer.sql)
* [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/PaulinaJohn/InterviewQs-Total_Grocery_Sales-SQL/blob/main/Total_Grocery_Sales-%20PostgreSQL.sql)
* BigQuery

Note that different RDBMSes could show differences in SQL dialects

* In MSSQL Server, you will use the T-SQL dialect.
* PostgreSQL uses the PL/pgSQL (PL- Procedural language), and;
* In BigQuery, You will come across Standard SQL.

The last will be uploaded soon.
